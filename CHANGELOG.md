# Tensors changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v1.17.0]

### Bugfixes
 
 - Throw error if trying to call fallback dot method for AbstractArray ([#228])
 - Fix that `curl(f, v::Vec{2})` calls `f(::Vec{3, <:Dual})` instead of `f(::Vec{2, <:Dual})`([#222])

### Added
 - Optimized version to compute cofactor matrix (also called the minor of a matrix) ([#218])

## [v1.16.2]

### Misc

 - Relax compat for ForwardDiff to allow version 1 ([#225]).

## [v1.16.1]

### Bugfixes

 - Fix that `tovoigt!(::Vector{TA}, ::AbstractTensor{order,dim,TB})` didn't work after v1.15 unless `TA==TB` ([#212]).

## [v1.16.0]

### Added
 - Partial support for 3rd order Tensors ([#205]):
    * All construction methods, e.g. `zero(Tensor{3})`, `rand(Tensor{3})`, `Tensor{3}((i,j,k)->f(i,j,k))`
    * Gradient of 2nd order tensor wrt. vector
    * `rotate(::Tensor{3})`
    * `dcontract(::Tensor{D1}, ::Tensor{D2})` for (D1,D2) in ((2,3), (3,2), (3,4), (4,3))
    * `otimes(::Vec, ::SecondOrderTensor)` and `otimes(::SecondOrderTensor, ::Vec)`
    * `dot(::Tensor{D1}, ::Tensor{D2})` for (D1,D2) in ((3,1), (1,3), (2,3), (3,2))
